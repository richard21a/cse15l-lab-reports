# Lab Report 4

[Our Repository](https://github.com/AnniePhan02/CSE15L-Panther)

[Repository that we reviewed](https://github.com/ShashankVenkatramani/markdown-parse/)

By using the preview feature in VScode, I determined the valid links each snippet:

Snippet 1: [url.com, google.com]

Snippet 2: [a.com, example.com]

Snippet 3: [https://www.twitter.com, https://ucsd-cse15l-w22.github.io/, https://cse.ucsd.edu/]

MarkdownParseTest.java to test the 3 snippets
